<h1> Welcome to my Porfolio! </h1>
<p> To quickly navigate my portfolio, you can go to "My Projects" at the top and see all my work categorized. You can also see those same projects right below this 
    in order from most recent. </p>

<p> My projects are a mix of work that I have completed in school as well as personal projects that I have started in my own free time. The projects that I post here are meant to show
    my progress in learning both programming languages and networking/cybersecurity fundamentals.
