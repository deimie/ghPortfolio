<h1> Welcome to my Porfolio! </h1>
<p> To quickly navigate my portfolio, you can go to "My Projects" at the top and see all my work categorized. You can also see those same projects right below this 
    in order from most recent. </p>

<p> Everything on this page are personal projects that I have started in my free time. These projects are mainly meant to show
    my progress in learning both networking & cybersecurity fundamentals, as well as to serve as a reference if I ever revisit old projects.
